	abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) speed control scheme for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. The proposed controller consists of three control terms: a decoupling term, a PID term, and a supervisory term. The first control term is employed to compensate for the nonlinear factors, the second term is made to automatically adjust the control gains, and the third one is designed to guarantee the system stability. Different from the offline-tuning PID controllers, the proposed adaptive controller includes adaptive tuning laws to online adjust the control gains based on the gradient descent method. Thus, it can adaptively deal with any system parameter uncertainties in reality. The proposed scheme is not only simple and easy to implement, but also it guarantees an accurate and fast speed tracking. It is proven that the control system is asymptotically stable. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the comparative experiments between the proposed adaptive PID controller and the conventional PID controller are performed on the PMSM drive. Finally, it is validated that the proposed design scheme accomplishes the superior control performance (faster transient response and smaller steady-state error) compared to the conventional PID method in the presence of parameter uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) being the most simple and the widely deployed controller in the industrial drives is not quite amenable to the solution for high performance drives as these drives are subjected to the parametric uncertainty, unmodeled dynamics and variable load conditions during operation. In order to expand the robustness and adaptive capabilities of conventional PID controller, a neural network based PID (NNPID) like controller which is tuned when the controller is operating in an on line mode for high performance permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) position control is proposed in this paper. The NN based PID like controller is composed of a mixed locally recurrent neural network and contains at most three hidden nodes which form a PID like structure. A novel training algorithm for the PID controller gain initialization based upon the minimum norm least square solution is proposed. An on line sequential training algorithm based on recursive least square is then derived to update controller gains in an on line manner. The proposed controller is not only easy to implement but also requires least number of parameters to be tuned prior to the implementation. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated in the presence of parametric uncertainties and load disturbances also the result outcomes are compared with the conventional PID controller, optimized using Cuckoo search based optimization method.},

	abstract = {A decentralized PID neural network (PIDNN) control scheme was proposed to a quadrotor helicopter subjected to wind disturbance. First, the dynamic model that considered the effect of wind disturbance was established via Newton-Euler formalism. For quadrotor helicopter flying at low altitude in actual situation, it was more susceptible to be influenced by the turbulent wind field. Therefore, the turbulent wind field was generated according to Dryden model and taken into consideration as the disturbance source of quadrotor helicopter. Then, a nested loop control approach was proposed for the stabilization and navigation problems of the quadrotor subjected to wind disturbance. A decentralized PIDNN controller was designed for the inner loop to stabilize the attitude angle. A conventional PID controller was used for the outer loop in order to generate the reference path to inner loop. Moreover, the connective weights of the PIDNN were trained on-line by error back-propagation method. Furthermore, the initial connective weights were identified according to the principle of PID control theory and the appropriate learning rate was selected by discrete Lyapunov theory in order to ensure the stability. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the controller can effectively resist external wind disturbances, and presents good stability, maneuverability and robustness.},

For neural network training, a variant of the well-known gradient steepest descent method is employed where the learning rate is adapted in each iteration step in order to accelerate the speed of convergence. It is shown that appropriate selection of the learning rate results in stable training in Lyapunov sense. The closed-loop control system consists of two neural networks. The first one is a feedforward neural network that is employed as a predictive hybrid model of the controlled plant. The second network is a neural PID-like controller, which has been pre-trained off-line as an inverse black-box model of the controlled process. To ensure offset-free performance, additional on-line tuning of the neural controller is required, especially in the presence of process uncertainties and time-varying parameters. Advantages of the proposed technique are demonstrated through simulation experiments for a case study, investigating the control of a continuous flow stirred biochemical reactor.},

This novel control is a natural combination of industrial linear PID control and neural compensation.

This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous, and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using field-oriented control to produce 3-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the grid side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and grid side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and online learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.
